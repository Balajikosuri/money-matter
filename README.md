### **Code Guidelines**

- Write self-explanatory code: Give meaningful names to components, methods, and variables to increase the readability of the code.
- Don't use flag arguments (Ex: booleans), instead split components/ functions that can be used without the flag.
    - Read more: https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/what-is-wrong-with-boolean-parameters/#4-otherwise-split-the-function
- Extract magic numbers & strings into constants :
    - Read more here: https://www.codingzeal.com/post/developer-dark-arts-magic-strings
- Always use destructuring.

### React Specific Guidelines

- A component has aÂ **single responsibility,** which means it has one reason to change.
- Writing reusable components:
    - Able to customize the UI
    - Expose necessary props
- Create separate files for each component.
- Handle all the API statuses like Loading, Success and Failure, etc.,

### Development Process

- Go through the given screens
- Prepare **ELP**(Execution Level Plan) i.e
    - Break the UI into Component Hierarchy
    - Identify the minimal state & where to maintain it
    - List down different **cases** for the components
- Start building with common components and gradually compose them to get the given UI.
- Maintain proper Git History with appropriate commit messages
- **Self-review** your code against the guidelines before you submit it.
